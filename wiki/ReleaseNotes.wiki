#summary Release notes

= Release notes for 0.5 =

The following features have been added in this release:
  * (Partial) support for WAS 6.1.
  * Support for Apache Harmony 5.0 and 6.0 JDKs.
  * Arit can now be deployed on a WAS 7.0 with Java 2 security enabled.
  * The following new resource types have been added:
     * RMI exports
     * Cached !ResourceBundle instances
     * JCE providers
  * Arit now exposes an MBean that sends out notifications about detected leaks.
  * For EAR files built using Maven, the artifact identifier (groupId, artifactId, version) is shown in the report (WAS 7.0 only).

This release also solves the redirection issue, i.e. the report can accessed using `/arit`.

Known issues and limitations:
  * Arit will not run on WAS 7.0 with a fix pack level lower than 7.0.0.7.
  * On WAS 6.1, some icons are rendered incorrectly (black opaque background instead of transparency).

= Release notes for 0.4 =

This release is primarily targeted at !WebSphere 7.0 and adds the following new features:
  * A graphical view that reproduces the class loader hierarchy and that shows the status (started or stopped/defunct) of each module, so that leaks can be identified easily.
  * Arit now runs on any Java version, regardless of the version on which it has been built.
  * Detection of a particular kind of memory leak that occurs on WAS 7.0 (see APAR IZ67457).

Known issues and limitations:
  * Arit will not run on WAS 7.0 with a fix pack level lower than 7.0.0.7.
  * Redirection is not properly working in Arit 0.4. To access the report, use `/arit/report.html` instead of `/arit`.

= Release notes for 0.3 =

This release adds support for MBeans. In addition, there have been two important architectural changes:
  * Arit now uses the Plexus container.
  * The concept of _RBean_ has been introduced to simplify reflection.

*Important notice for !WebSphere users*: This release requires at least version 7.0.0.7 because Plexus is impacted by APAR PK86109.

Due to a bug, version 0.3 will only run correctly on the JDK on which it has been built, i.e. the EAR or WAR built with Java 1.5 will not run on Java 1.6 and vice versa. Note that the EAR in the download section has been built with 1.6.
