= Release notes for 0.3 =

This release adds support for MBeans. In addition, there have been two important architectural changes:
  * Arit now uses the Plexus container.
  * The concept of _RBean_ has been introduced to simplify reflection.

*Important notice for Websphere users*: This release requires at least version 7.0.0.7 because Plexus is impacted by APAR PK86109.
