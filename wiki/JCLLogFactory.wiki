However, there is really only one setup where using JCL may cause a class loader leak. In fact, this occurs when both of the following two conditions are met:
  * Commons logging is installed into the server runtime although the application server has no explicit support for this configuration. Indeed most servers have a mechanism that allows to add arbitrary JARs to some class loader that is an ancestor of all application class loaders.
