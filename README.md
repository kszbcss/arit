Arit is a tool that helps identifying and monitoring common types of class loader leaks in J2EE environments without the need to take a heap dump of the Java process. Instead, Arit is deployed as a simple Web application and is able to generate an online report of the detected leaks.

Documentation is available on the [github wiki](https://github.com/kszbcss/arit/wiki).
To learn more about class loader leaks and how Arit works, have a look at the [Getting Started](https://github.com/kszbcss/arit/wiki/GettingStarted) page.
